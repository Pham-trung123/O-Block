# 🛡️ Phish Hunters Application – Phishing Email Detection and Alert System


**Developed by O-Block Team — Secure. Fast. Intelligent.**

---

## 🧭 Overview

This project implements the Phish Hunters Web Application, a cybersecurity system designed to detect and alert users about phishing emails using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies.
The main goal of the system is to help users identify malicious or deceptive emails, prevent data theft, and enhance cybersecurity awareness.

Phish Hunters enables users to analyze email content, detect suspicious links, and receive real-time alerts about potential phishing threats.
The system is developed using C# (ASP.NET) with a Firebase database and a modern, responsive web interface, ensuring security, efficiency, and scalability in real-world deployment.

## 🧩System Architecture – Phish Hunters Application

### 🔐 Core Functional Principles

**Threat Detection using AI/NLP** – Automatically analyze email text and metadata to identify phishing indicators.

**Real-time Alerting** – Provide immediate warning notifications to users when phishing content is detected.

**Secure Authentication** – Protect user access with JWT-based authentication and encrypted communication.

**Data Integrity & Privacy** – Store analyzed results securely in Firebase with strict access control.

**Continuous Monitoring** – Track user activity, detection logs, and system health in real time.

           ⬇
        HTTPS / REST API
           ⬇
| ⚙️ Backend Layer |
| (C# ASP.NET Core) |
|--------------------------------|
|  - Handles email analysis requests |
|  - Integrates AI/NLP detection module |
|  - Generates and stores alert data   |
|--------------------------------|
           ⬇

## 🛡️ Security Highlights

-**HTTPS Enforcement** – All API communications are encrypted.

-**JWT Authentication** – Verifies users before allowing access to the system.

-**Input Validation & Sanitization** – Prevents malicious data injection.

-**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Separates user, admin, and system privileges.

-**Audit Logs** – Tracks phishing detection events and user actions for traceability.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
