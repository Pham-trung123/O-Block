# 🛡️ Phish Hunters Application – Phishing Email Detection and Alert System


**Developed by O-Block Team — Secure. Fast. Intelligent.**

---

## 🧭 Overview

This project implements the Phish Hunters Web Application, a cybersecurity system designed to detect and alert users about phishing emails using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies.
The main goal of the system is to help users identify malicious or deceptive emails, prevent data theft, and enhance cybersecurity awareness.

Phish Hunters enables users to analyze email content, detect suspicious links, and receive real-time alerts about potential phishing threats.
The system is developed using C# (ASP.NET) with a Firebase database and a modern, responsive web interface, ensuring security, efficiency, and scalability in real-world deployment.
